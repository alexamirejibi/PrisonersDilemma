# Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Simulation
In this project, I explore the dynamics of multi-agent Prisoner's Dilemma environments by learning optimal cooperation policies under various conditions using a genetic algorithm.

This project was done for the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence class at Northeaster, Spring 2023.
